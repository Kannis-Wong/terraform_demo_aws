# terraform_demo_aws
This repository provides a quick overview of using Terraform with the AWS cloud provider. It includes examples and best practices for deploying and managing infrastructure on AWS using Terraform, a popular infrastructure-as-code tool. 
Whether you're new to Terraform or an experienced user, this repository can help you get up and running quickly with AWS.

Shown below is the architecture diagram for the provisioning of our infrastructure. 
This diagram provides a visual representation of all the components involved in our infrastructure setup, their relationships, and how they interact with each other.

We will create two EC2 in different AZ and with network load balancer in specific VPC.
